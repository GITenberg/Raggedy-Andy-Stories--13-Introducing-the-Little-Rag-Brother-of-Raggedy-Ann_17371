Dear Johnny:</div>

<p>When I saw your Raggedy Ann books and dolls in a store near here, I went
right in and bought one of each, and when I had read your introduction
to "Raggedy Ann" I went right up to an old trunk in my own attic and
brought down the doll I am sending you with this letter.</p>

<p>This doll belonged to my mother and she played with it when a little
girl. She treasured it highly, I know, for she kept it until I came and
then she gave it to me.</p>

<p>The fun that we two have had together I cannot begin to tell you, but
often, like the little boy who went out into the garden to eat worms
when all the world seemed blue and clouded, this doll and I went out
under the arbor and had our little cry together. I can still feel it's
soft rag arms (as I used to imagine) about me, and hear the words of
comfort (also imaginary) that were whispered in my ear.</p>

<p>As you say in your Raggedy Ann book, "Fairyland must be filled with rag
dolls, soft loppy rag dolls who go through all the beautiful adventures
found there, nestling in the crook of a dimpled arm." I truly believe
there is such a fairyland and that rag dolls were first made there, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
how else could they bring so much sunshine into a child's life?</p>

</div>

<p>All the little girls of my acquaintance have your Raggedy Ann book and
doll, and for the happiness you have brought to them let me give to you
the doll of all my dolls, the doll I loved most dearly.</p>

<p>May it prove to you a gift from Fairyland, bringing with it all the
"wish come true" that you may wish and, if possible, add to the sunshine
in your life.</p>

<p>My mother called the doll Raggedy Andy and it was by this name that I
have always known him. Is it any wonder that I was surprised when I saw
the title of your book?</p>

<p>Introduce Raggedy Andy to Raggedy Ann, dear Johnny. Let him share in the
happiness of your household.</p>

Dear John:</div>

<p>Your letter brings many pleasant memories to my mind and takes me back
to my childhood.</p>

<p>Living next door to us, when I was about four years old, was a little
girl named Bessie; I cannot recall her last name.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> When my mother made
Raggedy Ann for me, Bessie's mother made a rag doll for her, for we two
always played together; as I recall, there was no fence between our two
houses.</p>

<p>Bessie's doll was made a day or so after Raggedy Ann, I think, though I
am not quite certain which of the two dolls was made first. However,
Bessie's doll was given the name of Raggedy Andy, and one of the two
dolls was named after the other, so that their names would sound alike.</p>

<p>We children played with the two rag dolls most of the time until
Bessie's family moved away&mdash;when I was eight or nine years old. They had
faces just alike; the mother who made the first doll probably painted
both doll faces. I do not remember just how Raggedy Andy was dressed,
but I know he often wore dresses over his boy clothes when Bessie and I
decided that he and Raggedy Ann should be sisters for the day.</p>

<p>You will remember I told you about Raggedy Andy long ago, John.</p>

<p>Isn't it strange that the two old rag dolls should come together after
all these years? I wish Raggedy Andy's "Mama" had signed her name, for I
should like to write to her. Perhaps there may be some way of finding
her out.</p>

<p>Anyway, it seems to me you have the subject for another rag doll book,
for Raggedy Andy must have had some wonderful adventures in his long
life.</p>

<div class='right'>
<span style="margin-left: 18em;">Yours lovingly,</span><br />
Mom.<br />

<h2><a name="HOW_RAGGEDY_ANDY_CAME" id="HOW_RAGGEDY_ANDY_CAME"></a>HOW RAGGEDY ANDY CAME</h2>


<p>One day Daddy took Raggedy Ann down to his office and propped her up
against some books upon his desk; he wanted to have her where he could
see her cheery smile all day, for, as you must surely know, smiles and
happiness are truly catching.</p>

<p>Daddy wished to catch a whole lot of Raggedy Ann's cheeriness and
happiness and put all this down on paper, so that those who did not have
Raggedy Ann dolls might see just how happy and smiling a rag doll can
be.</p>

<p>So Raggedy Ann stayed at Daddy's studio for three or four days.</p>

<p>She was missed very, very much at home and Marcella really longed for
her, but knew that Daddy was borrowing some of Raggedy Ann's sunshine,
so she did not complain.</p>

<p>Raggedy Ann did not complain either, for in addition to the sunny, happy
smile she always wore (it was painted on), Raggedy Ann had a candy
heart, and of course no one (not even a rag doll) ever complains if they
have such happiness about them.</p>

<p>One evening, just as Daddy was finishing his day's work, a messenger boy
came with a package; a nice, soft lumpy package.</p>

<p>Daddy opened the nice, soft lumpy package and found a letter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>Gran'ma had told Daddy, long before this, that at the time Raggedy Ann
was made, a neighbor lady had made a boy doll, Raggedy Andy, for her
little girl, who always played with Gran'ma.</p>

<p>And when Gran'ma told Daddy this she wondered whatever had become of her
little playmate and the boy doll, Raggedy Andy.</p>

<p>After reading the letter, Daddy opened the other package which had been
inside the nice, soft, lumpy package and found&mdash;Raggedy Andy.</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy had been carefully folded up.</p>

<p>His soft, loppy arms were folded up in front of him and his soft, loppy
legs were folded over his soft, loppy arms, and they were held this way
by a rubber band.</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy must have wondered why he was being "done up" this way, but
it could not have caused him any worry, for in between where his feet
came over his face Daddy saw his cheery smile.</p>

<p>After slipping off the rubber band, Daddy smoothed out the wrinkles in
Raggedy Andy's arms and legs.</p>

<p>Then Daddy propped Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy up against books on his
desk, so that they sat facing each other; Raggedy Ann's shoe button eyes
looking straight into the shoe button eyes of Raggedy Andy.</p>

<p>They could not speak&mdash;not right out before a real person&mdash;so they just
sat there and smiled at each other.</p>

<p>Daddy could not help reaching out his hands and feeling their throats.</p>

<p>Yes! There was a lump in Raggedy Ann's throat, and there was a lump in
Raggedy Andy's throat. A cotton lump, to be sure, but a lump
nevertheless.</p>

<p>"So, Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy, that is why you cannot talk, is it?"
said Daddy.</p>

<p>"I will go away and let you have your visit to yourselves, although it
is good to sit and share your happiness by watching you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus-012.jpg" width="350" height="313" alt="Then Daddy propped Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy up" title="Then Daddy propped Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy up" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>Daddy then took the rubber band and placed it around Raggedy Ann's right
hand, and around Raggedy Andy's right hand, so that when he had it fixed
properly they sat and held each other's hands.</p>

<p>Daddy knew they would wish to tell each other all the wonderful things
that had happened to them since they had parted more than fifty years
before.</p>

<p>So, locking his studio door, Daddy left the two old rag dolls looking
into each other's eyes.</p>

<p>The next morning, when Daddy unlocked his door and looked at his desk,
he saw that Raggedy Andy had fallen over so that he lay with his head in
the bend of Raggedy Ann's arm.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_NURSERY_DANCE" id="THE_NURSERY_DANCE"></a>THE NURSERY DANCE</h2>


<p>When Raggedy Andy was first brought to the nursery he was very quiet.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus-013.jpg" width="253" height="400" alt="Side by side" title="Side by side" />
</div>

<p>Raggedy Andy did not speak all day, but he smiled pleasantly to all the
other dolls. There was Raggedy Ann, the French doll, Henny, the little
Dutch doll, Uncle Clem, and a few others.</p>

<p>Some of the dolls were without arms and legs.</p>

<p>One had a cracked head. She was a nice doll, though, and the others all
liked her very much.</p>

<p>All of them had cried the night Susan (that was her name) fell off the
toy box and cracked her china head.</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy did not speak all day.</p>

<p>But there was really nothing strange about this fact, after all.</p>

<p>None of the other dolls spoke all day, either.</p>

<p>Marcella had played in the nursery all day and of course they did not
speak in front of her.</p>

<p>Marcella thought they did, though, and often had them saying things
which they really were not even thinking of.</p>

<p>For instance, when Marcella served water with sugar in it and little
oyster crackers for "tea," Raggedy Andy was thinking of Raggedy Ann, and
the French doll was thinking of one time when Fido was lost.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>Marcella took the French doll's hand, and passed a cup of "tea" to
Raggedy Andy, and said, "Mr. Raggedy Andy, will you have another cup of
tea?" as if the French doll was talking.</p>

<p>And then Marcella answered for Raggedy Andy, "Oh, yes, thank you! It is
so delicious!"</p>

<p>Neither the French doll nor Raggedy Andy knew what was going on, for
they were thinking real hard to themselves.</p>

<p>Nor did they drink the tea when it was poured for them. Marcella drank
it instead.</p>

<p>Perhaps this was just as well, for, most of the dolls were moist inside
from the "tea" of the day before.</p>

<p>Marcella did not always drink all of the tea, often she poured a little
down their mouths.</p>

<p>Sugar and water, if taken in small quantities, would not give the dolls
colic, Marcella would tell them, but she did not know that it made their
cotton, or sawdust insides, quite sticky.</p>

<p>Quite often, too, Marcella forgot to wash their faces after a "tea," and
Fido would do it for them when he came into the nursery and found the
dolls with sweets upon their faces.</p>

<p>Really, Fido was quite a help in this way, but he often missed the
corners of their eyes and the backs of their necks where the "tea" would
run and get sticky. But he did his best and saved his little Mistress a
lot of work.</p>

<p>No, Raggedy Andy did not speak; he merely thought a great deal.</p>

<p>One can, you know, when one has been a rag doll as long as Raggedy Andy
had. Years and years and years and years!</p>

<p>Even Raggedy Ann, with all her wisdom, did not really know how long
Raggedy Andy and she had been rag dolls.</p>

<p>If Raggedy Ann had a pencil in her rag hand and Marcella guided it for
her, Raggedy Ann could count up to ten&mdash;sometimes. But why should one
worry one's rag head about one's age when all one's life has been one
happy experience after another, with each day filled with love and
sunshine?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 254px;">
<img src="images/illus-016.jpg" width="254" height="400" alt="Raggedy Andy in a chair" title="Raggedy Andy in a chair" />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Raggedy Andy did not know his age, but he remembered many things that
had happened years and years and years ago, when he and Raggedy Ann were
quite young.</p>

<p>It was of these pleasant times Raggedy Andy was thinking all day, and
this was the reason he did not notice that Marcella was speaking for
him.</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy could patiently wait until Marcella put all the dollies to
bed and left them for the night, alone in the nursery.</p>

<p>The day might have passed very slowly had it not been for the happy
memories which filled Raggedy Andy's cotton-stuffed head.</p>

<p>But he did not even fidget.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 255px;">
<img src="images/illus-018.jpg" width="255" height="400" alt="Raggedy Andy on his face" title="Raggedy Andy on his face" />
</div>

<p>Of course, he fell out of his chair once, and his shoe button eyes went
"Click!" against the floor, but it wasn't his fault. Raggedy Andy was so
loppy he could hardly be placed in a chair so that he would stay, and
Marcella jiggled the table.</p>

<p>Marcella cried for Raggedy Andy, "AWAA! AWAA!" and picked him up and
snuggled him and scolded Uncle Clem for jiggling the table.</p>

<p>Through all this Raggedy Andy kept right on thinking his pleasant
thoughts, and really did not know he had fallen from the chair.</p>

<p>You see how easy it is to pass over the little bumps of life if we are
happy inside.</p>

<p>And so Raggedy Andy was quiet all day, and so the day finally passed.</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy was given one of Uncle Clem's clean white nighties and
shared Uncle Clem's bed. Marcella kissed them all good night and left
them to sleep until morning.</p>

<p>But as soon as she had left the room all the dolls raised up in their
beds. When their little mistress' footsteps passed out of hearing, all
the dollies jumped out of their beds and gathered around Raggedy Andy.</p>

<p>Raggedy Ann introduced them one by one and Raggedy Andy shook hands with
each.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-019.jpg" width="400" height="264" alt="Shaking hands" title="Shaking hands" />

</div>

<p>"I am very happy to know you all!" he said, in a voice as kindly as
Raggedy Ann's, "and I hope we will all like each other as much as
Raggedy Ann and I have always liked each other!"</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed we shall!" the dollies all answered. "We love Raggedy Ann
because she is so kindly and happy, and we know we shall like you too,
for you talk like Raggedy Ann and have the same cheery smile!"</p>

<p>"Now that we know each other so well, what do you say to a game, Uncle
Clem?" Raggedy Andy cried, as he caught Uncle Clem and danced about the
floor.</p>

<p>Henny, the Dutch doll, dragged the little square music box out into the
center of the room and wound it up. Then all, catching hands, danced in
a circle around it, laughing and shouting in their tiny doll voices.</p>

<p>"That was lots of fun!" Raggedy Andy said, when the music stopped and
all the dolls had taken seats upon the floor facing him. "You know I
have been shut up in a trunk up in an attic for years and years and
years."</p>

<p>"Wasn't it very lonesome in the trunk all that time?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> Susan asked in
her queer little cracked voice. You see, her head had been cracked.</p>

<p>"Oh, not at all," Raggedy Andy replied, "for there was always a nest of
mice down in the corner of the trunk. Cute little Mama and Daddy mice,
and lots of little teeny weeny baby mice. And when the mama and daddy
mice were away, I used to cuddle the tiny little baby mice!"</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-020.jpg" width="400" height="354" alt="Raggedy Andy and a mouse" title="Raggedy Andy and a mouse" />
</div>
<p>"No wonder you were never lonesome!" said Uncle Clem, who was very kind
and loved everybody and everything.</p>

<p>"No, I was never lonesome in the old trunk in the attic, but it is far
more pleasant to be out again and living here with all you nice
friends!" said Raggedy Andy.</p>

<p>And all the dolls thought so too, for already they loved Raggedy Andy's

<p>One night, after all the household had settled down to sleep, Raggedy
Andy sat up in bed and tickled Uncle Clem.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 260px;">
<img src="images/illus-021.jpg" width="260" height="400" alt="Raggedy Andy in bed" title="Raggedy Andy in bed" />
</div>
<p>Uncle Clem twisted and wiggled in his sleep until finally he could stand
it no longer and awakened.</p>

<p>"I dreamed that some one told me the funniest story!" said Uncle Clem;
"But I cannot remember what it was!"</p>

<p>"I was tickling you!" laughed Raggedy Andy.</p>

<p>When the other dolls in the nursery heard Raggedy Andy and Uncle Clem
talking, they too sat up in their beds.</p>

<p>"We've been so quiet all day," said Raggedy Andy. "Let's have a good
romp!"</p>

<p>This suggestion suited all the dolls, so they jumped out of their beds
and ran over towards Raggedy Andy's and Uncle Clem's little bed.</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy, always in for fun, threw his pillow at Henny, the Dutch
doll.</p>

<p>Henny did not see the pillow coming towards him so he was knocked head
over heels.</p>

<p>Henny always said "Mama" when he was tilted backward or forward, and
when the pillow rolled him over and over, he cried, "Mama, Mama, Mama!"</p>

<p>It was not because it hurt him, for you know Santa Claus always sees to
it that each doll he makes in his great workshop <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>is covered with a very
magical Wish, and this Wish always keeps them from getting hurt.</p>

<p>Henny could talk just as well as any of the other dolls when he was
standing up, sitting, or lying down, but if he was being tipped forward
and backward, all he could say was, "Mama."</p>

<p>This amused Henny as much as it did the other dolls, so when he jumped
to his feet he laughed and threw the pillow back at Raggedy Andy.</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy tried to jump to one side, but forgot that he was on the
bed, and he and Uncle Clem went tumbling to the floor.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 254px;">
<img src="images/illus-024.jpg" width="254" height="400" alt="Pillow fight" title="Pillow fight" />
</div>

<p>Then all the dolls ran to their beds and brought their pillows and had
the jolliest pillow fight imaginable.</p>

<p>The excitement ran so high and the pillows flew so fast, the floor of
the nursery was soon covered with feathers. It was only when all the
dolls had stopped to rest and put the feathers back into the pillow
cases that Raggedy Andy discovered he had lost one of his arms in the
scuffle.</p>

<p>The dolls were worried over this and asked, "What will Marcella say when
she sees that Raggedy Andy has lost an arm?"</p>

<p>"We can push it up his sleeve!" said Uncle Clem. "Then when Raggedy Andy
is taken out of bed in the morning, Marcella will find his arm is
loose!"</p>

<p>"It has been hanging by one or two threads for a day or more!" said
Raggedy Andy. "I noticed the other day that sometimes my thumb was
turned clear around to the back, and I knew then that the arm was
hanging by one or two threads and the threads were twisted."</p>

<p>Uncle Clem pushed Raggedy Andy's arm up through his sleeve, but every
time Raggedy Andy jumped about, he lost his arm again.</p>

<p>"This will never do!" said Raggedy Ann. "Raggedy Andy is lopsided with
only one arm and he cannot join in our games as well as if he had two
arms!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mind that!" laughed Raggedy Andy. "Mar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>cella will sew it
on in the morning and I will be all right, I'm sure!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps Raggedy Ann can sew it on now!" suggested Uncle Clem.</p>

<p>"Yes, Raggedy Ann can sew it on!" all the dolls cried. "She can play
Peter, Peter, Pumpkin Eater on the toy piano and she can sew!"</p>

<p>"I will gladly try," said Raggedy Ann, "but there are no needles or
thread in the nursery, and I have to have a thimble so the needle can be
pressed through Raggedy Andy's cloth!"</p>

<p>"Marcella always gets a needle from Mama!" said the French Doll.</p>

<p>"I know," said Raggedy Ann, "but we cannot waken Mama to ask her!"</p>

<p>The dolls all laughed at this, for they knew very well that even had
Mama been awake, they would not have asked her for needle and thread,
because they did not wish her to know they could act and talk just like
real people.</p>

<p>"Perhaps we can get the things out of the machine drawer!" Henny
suggested.</p>

<p>"Yes," cried Susan, "let's all go get the things out of the machine
drawer! Come on, everybody!"</p>

<p>And Susan, although she had only a cracked head, ran out the nursery
door followed by all the rest of the dolls.</p>

<p>Even the tiny little penny dolls clicked their china heels upon the
floor as they followed the rest, and Raggedy Andy, carrying his loose
arm, thumped along in the rear.</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy had not lived in the house as long as the others; so he did
not know the way to the room in which the machine stood.</p>

<p>After much climbing and pulling, the needle and thread and thimble were
taken from the drawer, and all raced back again to the nursery.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-027.jpg" width="400" height="296" alt="Raggedy Ann sewing" title="Raggedy Ann sewing" />
</div>

<p>Uncle Clem took off Raggedy Andy's waist, and the other dolls all sat
around watching while Raggedy Ann sewed the arm on again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>Raggedy Ann had only taken two stitches when she began laughing so hard
she had to quit. Of course when Raggedy Ann laughed, all the other dolls
laughed too, for laughter, like yawning, is very catching.</p>

<p>"I was just thinking!" said Raggedy Ann. "Remember, 'way, 'way back, a
long, long time ago, I sewed this arm on once before?" she asked Raggedy
Andy.</p>

<p>"I do remember, now that you mention it," said Raggedy Andy, "but I can
not remember how the arm came off!"</p>

<p>"Tell us about it!" all the dolls cried.</p>

<p>"Let's see!" Raggedy Ann began. "Your Mistress left you over at our
house one night, and after everyone had gone to bed, we went up into the
attic!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! I do remember now!" Raggedy Andy laughed. "We played with the
large whirligig!"</p>

<p>"Yes," Raggedy Ann said. "The large spinning wheel. We held on to the
wheel and went round and round! And when we were having the most fun,
your feet got fastened between the wheel and the rod which held the
wheel in position and there you hung, head down!"</p>

<p>"I remember, you were working the pedal and I was sailing around very
fast," said Raggedy Andy, "and all of a sudden the wheel stopped!"</p>

<p>"We would have laughed at the time," Raggedy Ann explained to the other
dolls, "but you see it was quite serious."</p>

<p>"My mistress had put us both to bed for the night, and if she had
discovered us 'way up in the attic, she would have wondered how in the
world we got there! So there was nothing to do but get Raggedy Andy out
of the tangle!"</p>

<p>"But you pulled me out all right!" Raggedy Andy laughed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I pulled and I pulled until I pulled one of Raggedy Andy's arms
off," Raggedy Ann said. "And then I pulled and pulled until finally his
feet came out of the wheel and we both tumbled to the floor!"</p>

<p>"Then we ran downstairs as fast as we could and climbed into bed, didn't
we!" Raggedy Andy laughed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, we did!" Raggedy Ann replied. "And when we jumped into bed, we
remembered that we had left Raggedy Andy's arm lying up on the attic
floor, so we had to run back up there and get it! Remember, Raggedy
Andy?"</p>

<p>"Yes! Wasn't it lots of fun?"</p>

<p>"Indeed it was!" Raggedy Ann agreed.</p>

<p>"Raggedy Andy wanted to let the arm remain off until the next morning,
but I decided it would be better to have it sewed on, just as it had
been when Mistress put us to bed. So, just like tonight, we went to the
pincushion and found a needle and thread and I sewed it on for him!"</p>

<p>"There!" Raggedy Ann said, as she wound the thread around her hand and
pulled, so that the thread broke near Raggedy Andy's shoulder. "It's
sewed on again, good as new!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Raggedy Ann!" said Raggedy Andy, as he threw the arm about
Raggedy Ann's neck and gave her a hug.</p>

<p>"Now we can have another game!" Uncle Clem cried as he helped Raggedy
Andy into his waist and buttoned it for him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then the little Cuckoo Clock on the nursery wall went, "Whirrr!"
the little door opened, and the little bird put out his head and cried,
"Cuckoo! cuckoo! cuckoo! cuckoo!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-028.jpg" width="400" height="298" alt="Watching the cuckoo clock" title="Watching the cuckoo clock" />
</div>

<p>"No more games!" Raggedy Ann said. "We must be very quiet from now on.
The folks will be getting up soon!"</p>

<p>"Last one in bed is a monkey!" cried Raggedy Andy.</p>

<p>There was a wild scramble as the dolls rushed for their beds, and Susan,
having to be careful of her cracked head, was the monkey. So Raggedy
Andy, seeing that Susan was slow about getting into her bed, jumped out
and helped her.</p>

<p>Then, climbing into the little bed which Uncle Clem shared with him, he
pulled the covers up to his eyes and, after pretending to snore a couple
of times, he lay very quiet, thinking of the kindness of his doll
friends about him, until Marcella came and took him down to breakfast.</p>

<p>And all the other dolls smiled at him as he left the room, for they were
very happy to know that their little mistress loved him as much as they
did.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_TAFFY_PULL" id="THE_TAFFY_PULL"></a>THE TAFFY PULL</h2>


<p>"I know how we can have a whole lot of fun!" Raggedy Andy said to the
other dolls. "We'll have a taffy pull!"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 258px;">
<img src="images/illus-029.jpg" width="258" height="400" alt="Friends" title="Friends" />
</div>

<p>"Do you mean crack the whip, Raggedy Andy?" asked the French doll.</p>

<p>"He means a tug of war, don't you, Raggedy Andy?" asked Henny.</p>

<p>"No," Raggedy Andy replied, "I mean a taffy pull!"</p>

<p>"If it's lots of fun, then show us how to play the game!" Uncle Clem
said. "We like to have fun, don't we?" And Uncle Clem turned to all the
other dolls as he asked the question.</p>

<p>"It really is not a game," Raggedy Andy explained. "You see, it is only
a taffy pull.</p>

<p>"We take sugar and water and butter and a little vinegar and put it all
on the stove to cook. When it has cooked until it strings 'way out when
you dip some up in a spoon, or gets hard when you drop some of it in a
cup of water, then it is candy.</p>

<p>"Then it must be placed upon buttered plates until it has cooled a
little, and then each one takes some of the candy and pulls and pulls
until it gets real white. Then it is called 'Taffy'."</p>

<p>"That will be loads of fun!" "Show us how to begin!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> "Let's have a
taffy pull!" "Come on, everybody!" the dolls cried.</p>

<p>"Just one moment!" Raggedy Ann said. She had remained quiet before, for
she had been thinking very hard, so hard, in fact, that two stitches had
burst in the back of her rag head. The dolls, in their eagerness to have
the taffy pull, were dancing about Raggedy Andy, but when Raggedy Ann
spoke, in her soft cottony voice, they all quieted down and waited for
her to speak again.</p>

<p>"I was just thinking," Raggedy Ann said, "that it would be very nice to
have the taffy pull, but suppose some of the folks smell the candy while
it is cooking."</p>

<p>"There is no one at home!" Raggedy Andy said. "I thought of that,
Raggedy Ann. They have all gone over to Cousin Jenny's house and will
not be back until day after tomorrow. I heard Mama tell Marcella."</p>

<p>"If that is the case, we can have the taffy pull and all the fun that
goes with it!" Raggedy Ann cried, as she started for the nursery door.</p>

<p>After her ran all the dollies, their little feet pitter-patting across
the floor and down the hall.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 251px;">
<img src="images/illus-032.jpg" width="251" height="400" alt="They threw themselves down the stairs" title="They threw themselves down the stairs" />
</div>

<p>When they came to the stairway Raggedy Ann, Raggedy Andy, Uncle Clem and
Henny threw themselves down the stairs, turning over and over as they
fell.</p>

<p>The other dolls, having china heads, had to be much more careful; so
they slid down the banisters, or jumped from one step to another.</p>

<p>Raggedy Ann, Raggedy Andy, Uncle Clem and Henny piled in a heap at the
bottom of the steps, and by the time they had untangled themselves and
helped each other up, the other dolls were down the stairs.</p>

<p>To the kitchen they all raced. There they found the fire in the stove
still burning.</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy brought a small stew kettle, while the others brought the
sugar and water and a large spoon. They could not find the vinegar and
decided not to use it, anyway.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>Raggedy Andy stood upon the stove and watched the candy, dipping into it
every once in a while to see if it had cooked long enough, and stirring
it with the large spoon.</p>

<p>At last the candy began to string out from the spoon when it was held
above the stew kettle, and after trying a few drops in a cup of cold
water, Raggedy Andy pronounced it "done."</p>

<p>Uncle Clem pulled out a large platter from the pantry, and Raggedy Ann
dipped her rag hand into the butter jar and buttered the platter.</p>

<p>The candy, when it was poured into the platter, was a lovely golden
color and smelled delicious to the dolls. Henny could not wait until it
cooled; so he put one of his chamois skin hands into the hot candy.</p>

<p>Of course it did not burn Henny, but when he pulled his hand out again,
it was covered with a great ball of candy, which strung out all over the
kitchen floor and got upon his clothes.</p>

<p>Then too, the candy cooled quickly, and in a very short time Henny's
hand was encased in a hard ball of candy. Henny couldn't wiggle any of
his fingers on that hand and he was sorry he had been so hasty.</p>

<p>While waiting for the candy to cool, Raggedy Andy said, "We must rub
butter upon our hands before we pull the candy, or else it will stick to
our hands as it has done to Henny's hands and have to wear off!"</p>

<p>"Will this hard ball of candy have to wear off of my hand?" Henny asked.
"It is so hard, I cannot wiggle any of my fingers!"</p>

<p>"It will either have to wear off, or you will have to soak your hand in
water for a long time, until the candy on it melts!" said Raggedy Andy.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Henny.</p>

<p>Uncle Clem brought the poker then and, asking Henny to put his hand upon
the stove leg, he gave the hard candy a few sharp taps with the poker
and chipped the candy from Henny's hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you, Uncle Clem!" Henny said, as he wiggled his fingers. "That
feels much better!"</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy told all the dolls to rub butter upon their hands.</p>

<p>"The candy is getting cool enough to pull!" he said.</p>

<p>Then, when all the dolls had their hands nice and buttery, Raggedy Andy
cut them each a nice piece of candy and showed them how to pull it.</p>

<p>"Take it in one hand this way," he said, "and pull it with the other
hand, like this!"</p>

<p>When all the dolls were supplied with candy they sat about and pulled
it, watching it grow whiter and more silvery the longer they pulled.</p>

<p>Then, when the taffy was real white, it began to grow harder and harder,
so the smaller dolls could scarcely pull it any more.</p>

<p>When this happened, Raggedy Andy, Raggedy Ann, Uncle Clem and Henny, who
were larger, took the little dolls' candy and mixed it with what they
had been pulling until all the taffy was snow white.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-034.jpg" width="400" height="265" alt="The taffy pull" title="The taffy pull" />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Raggedy Andy pulled it out into a long rope and held it while Uncle
Clem hit the ends a sharp tap with the edge of the spoon.</p>

<p>This snipped the taffy into small pieces, just as easily as you might
break icicles with a few sharp taps of a stick.</p>

<p>The small pieces of white taffy were placed upon the buttered platter
again and the dolls all danced about it, singing and laughing, for this
had been the most fun they had had for a long, long time.</p>

<p>"But what shall we do with it?" Raggedy Ann asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, what shall we do with it!" Uncle Clem said. "We can't let it
remain in the platter here upon the kitchen floor! We must hide it, or
do something with it!"</p>

<p>"While we are trying to think of a way to dispose of it, let us be
washing the stew kettle and the spoon!" said practical Raggedy Ann.</p>

<p>"That is a very happy thought, Raggedy Ann!" said Raggedy Andy. "For it
will clean the butter and candy from our hands while we are doing it!"</p>

<p>So the stew kettle was dragged to the sink and filled with water, the
dolls all taking turns scraping the candy from the sides of the kettle,
and scrubbing the inside with a cloth.</p>

<p>When the kettle was nice and clean and had been wiped dry, Raggedy Andy
found a roll of waxed paper in the pantry upon one of the shelves.</p>

<p>"We'll wrap each piece of taffy in a nice little piece of paper," he
said, "then we'll find a nice paper bag, and put all the pieces inside
the bag, and throw it from the upstairs window when someone passes the
house so that someone may have the candy!"</p>

<p>All the dolls gathered about the platter on the floor, and while Raggedy
Andy cut the paper into neat squares, the dolls wrapped the taffy in the
papers.</p>

<p>Then the taffy was put into a large bag, and with much pulling and
tugging it was finally dragged up into the nursery, where a window faced
out toward the street.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, just as a little boy and a little girl, who looked as though they
did not ever have much candy, passed the house, the dolls all gave a
push and sent the bag tumbling to the sidewalk.</p>

<p>The two children laughed and shouted, "Thank you," when they saw that
the bag contained candy, and the dolls, peeping from behind the lace
curtains, watched the two happy faced children eating the taffy as they
skipped down the street.</p>

<p>When the children had passed out of sight, the dolls climbed down from
the window.</p>

<p>"That was lots of fun!" said the French doll, as she smoothed her skirts
and sat down beside Raggedy Andy.</p>

<p>"I believe Raggedy Andy must have a candy heart too, like Raggedy Ann!"
said Uncle Clem.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-036.jpg" width="400" height="198" alt="All sitting together" title="All sitting together" />
</div>

<p>"No!" Raggedy Andy answered, "I'm just stuffed with white cotton and I
have no candy heart, but some day perhaps I shall have!"</p>

<p>"A candy heart is very nice!" Raggedy Ann said. (You know, she had one.)
"But one can be just as nice and happy and full of sunshine without a
candy heart."</p>

<p>"I almost forgot to tell you," said Raggedy Andy, "that when pieces of
taffy are wrapped in little pieces of paper, just as we wrapped them,
they are called 'Kisses'."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_RABBIT_CHASE" id="THE_RABBIT_CHASE"></a>THE RABBIT CHASE</h2>


<p>"Well, what shall we play tonight?" asked Henny, the Dutch doll, when
the house was quiet and the dolls all knew that no one else was awake.</p>



<div class="figleft" style="width: 254px;">
<img src="images/illus-037.jpg" width="254" height="400" alt="Fido in a basket" title="Fido in a basket" />
</div><p>Raggedy Andy was just about to suggest a good game, when Fido, who
sometimes slept in a basket in the nursery, growled.</p>

<p>All the dollies looked in his direction.</p>

<p>Fido was standing up with his ears sticking as straight in the air as
loppy silken puppy dog ears can stick up.</p>

<p>"He must have been dreaming!" said Raggedy Andy.</p>

<p>"No, I wasn't dreaming!" Fido answered. "I heard something go, 'Scratch!
Scratch!' as plain as I hear you!"</p>

<p>"Where did the sound come from, Fido?" Raggedy Andy asked when he saw
that Fido really was wide awake.</p>

<p>"From outside somewhere!" Fido answered. "And if I could get out without
disturbing all the folks, I'd run out and see what it might be! Perhaps
I had better bark!"</p>

<p>"Please do not bark!" Raggedy Andy cried as he put his rag arm around
Fido's nose. "You will awaken everybody in the house. We can open a door
or a window for you and let you out, if you must go!"</p>

<p>"I wish you would. Listen! There it is again: 'Scratch! Scratch!' What
can it be?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"You may soon see!" said Raggedy Andy. "We'll let you out, but please
don't sit at the door and bark and bark to get back in again, as you
usually do, for we are going to play a good game and we may not hear
you!"</p>

<p>"You can sleep out in the shed after you have found out what it is,"
said Raggedy Andy.</p>

<p>As soon as the dolls opened the door for Fido, he went running across
the lawn, barking in a loud shrill voice. He ran down behind the shed
and through the garden, and then back towards the house again.</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy and Uncle Clem stood looking out of the door, the rest of
the dolls peeping over their shoulders, so when something came jumping
through the door, it hit Uncle Clem and Raggedy Andy and sent them
flying against the other dolls behind them.</p>

<p>All the dolls went down in a wiggling heap on the floor.</p>

<p>It was surprising that the noise and confusion did not waken Daddy and
the rest of the folks, for just as the dolls were untangling themselves
from each other and getting upon their feet, Fido came jumping through
the door and sent the dolls tumbling again.</p>

<p>Fido quit barking when he came through the door.</p>

<p>"Which way did he go?" he asked, when he could get his breath.</p>

<p>"What was it?" Raggedy Andy asked in return.</p>

<p>"It was a rabbit!" Fido cried. "He ran right in here, for I could smell
his tracks!"</p>

<p>"We could feel him!" Raggedy Andy laughed.</p>

<p>"I could not tell you which way he went!" Uncle Clem said, "Except I
feel sure he came through the door and into the house!"</p>

<p>None of the dolls knew into which room the rabbit had run.</p>

<p>Finally, after much sniffing, Fido traced the rabbit to the nursery,
where, when the dolls followed, they saw the rabbit crouching behind the
rocking horse.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>


<p>Fido whined and cried because he could not get to the rabbit and bite
him.</p>

<p>"You should be ashamed of yourself, Fido!" cried Raggedy Ann. "Just see
how the poor bunny is trembling!"</p>

<p>"He should not come scratching around our house if he doesn't care to be
chased!" said Fido.</p>

<img src="images/illus-041.jpg" width="400" height="264" alt="Raggedy Andy and the rabbit" title="Raggedy Andy and the rabbit" />
</div>
<p>"Why don't you stay out in the woods and fields where you really
belong?" Raggedy Andy asked the rabbit.</p>

<p>"I came to leave some Easter eggs!" the bunny answered in a queer little
quavery voice.</p>

<p>"An Easter bunny!" all the dolls cried, jumping about and clapping their
hands. "An Easter bunny!"</p>

<p>"Well!" was all Fido could say, as he sat down and began wagging his
tail.</p>

<p>"You may come out from behind the rocking horse now, Easter bunny!" said
Raggedy Andy. "Fido will not hurt you, now that he knows, will you,
Fido?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I won't!" Fido replied. "I'm sorry that I chased you! And I
remember now, I had to jump over a basket out by the shed! Was that
yours?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, it was full of Easter eggs and colored grasses for the little girl
who lives here!" the bunny said.</p>

<p>When the Easter bunny found out that Fido and the dolls were his
friends, he came out from behind the rocking horse and hopped across the
floor to the door.</p>

<p>"I must go see if any of the eggs are broken, for if they are, I will
have to run home and color some more! I was just about to make a nice
nest and put the eggs in it when Fido came bouncing out at me!"</p>

<p>And with a squeeky little laugh the Easter bunny, followed by Fido and
all the dolls, hopped across the lawn towards the shed. There they found
the basket. Four of the lovely colored Easter eggs were broken.</p>

<p>"I will run home and color four more. It will only take a few minutes,
so when I return and scratch again to make a nest, please do not bark at
me!" said the Easter bunny.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-042.jpg" width="400" height="332" alt="The Easter bunny" title="The Easter bunny" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>"I won't! I promise!" Fido laughed.</p>

<p>"May we go with you and watch you color the Easter eggs?" Raggedy Andy
begged.</p>

<p>"Indeed you may!" the Easter bunny answered. "Can you run fast?"</p>

<p>Then down through the garden and out through a crack in the fence the
Easter bunny hopped, with a long string of dolls trailing behind.</p>

<p>When they came to the Easter bunny's home, they found Mama Easter bunny
and a lot of little teeny weeny bunnies who would some day grow up to be
big Easter bunnies like their Mama and Daddy bunny.</p>

<p>The Easter bunny told them of his adventure with Fido, and all joined in
his laughter when they found it had turned out well at the end.</p>

<p>The Easter bunny put four eggs on to boil and while these were boiling
he mixed up a lot of pretty colors.</p>

<p>When the eggs were boiled, he dipped the four eggs into the pretty
colored dye and then painted lovely flowers on them.</p>

<p>When the Easter bunny had finished painting the eggs he put them in his
basket and, with all the dolls running along beside him, they returned
to the house.</p>

<p>"Why not make the nest right in the nursery?" Raggedy Andy asked.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 283px;">
<img src="images/illus-044.jpg" width="283" height="350" alt="How did the bunny get into this room?" title="" />
</div>

<p>"That would be just the thing! Then the little girl would wonder and
wonder how I could ever get into the nursery without awakening the rest
of the folks, for she will never suspect that you dolls and Fido let me
in!"</p>

<p>So with Raggedy Andy leading the way, they ran up to the nursery and
there, 'way back in a corner, they watched the Easter bunny make a
lovely nest and put the Easter eggs in it.</p>

<p>And in the morning when Marcella came in to see the dolls you can
imagine her surprise when she found the pretty gift of the Easter
bunny.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"How in the world did the bunny get inside the house and into this room
without awakening Fido?" she laughed.</p>

<p>And Fido, pretending to be asleep, slowly opened one eye and winked over
the edge of his basket at Raggedy Andy.</p>

<p>And Raggedy Andy smiled back at Fido, but never said a word.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_NEW_TIN_GUTTER" id="THE_NEW_TIN_GUTTER"></a>THE NEW TIN GUTTER</h2>


<p>All day Saturday the men had worked out upon the eaves of the house and
the dolls facing the window could see them.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 260px;">
<img src="images/illus-045.jpg" width="260" height="400" alt="Looking out the window" title="Looking out the window" />
</div>
<p>The men made quite a lot of noise with their hammers, for they were
putting new gutters around the eaves, and pounding upon tin makes a
great deal of noise.</p>

<p>Marcella had not played with the dolls all that day, for she had gone
visiting; so when the men hammered and made a lot of noise, the dolls
could talk to each other without fear of anyone hearing or knowing they
were really talking to each other.</p>

<p>"What are they doing now?" Raggedy Andy asked.</p>

<p>He was lying with his head beneath a little bed quilt, just as Marcella
had dropped him when she left the nursery; so he could not see what was
going on.</p>

<p>"We can only see the men's legs as they pass the window," answered Uncle
Clem. "But they are putting new shingles or something on the roof!"</p>

<p>After the men had left their work and gone home to supper and the house
was quiet, Raggedy Andy cautiously moved his head out from under the
little bed quilt and, seeing that the coast was clear, sat up.</p>

<p>This was a signal for all the dolls to sit up and smooth out the
wrinkles in their clothes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-047.jpg" width="400" height="268" alt="Lifting the penny dolls" title="Lifting the penny dolls" />

</div>

<p>The nursery window was open; so Raggedy Andy lifted the penny dolls to
the sill and climbed up beside them.</p>

<p>Leaning out, he could look along the new shiny tin gutter the men had
put in place.</p>

<p>"Here's a grand place to have a lovely slide!" he said as he gave one of
the penny dolls a scoot down the shiny tin gutter.</p>

<p>"Whee! See her go!" Raggedy Andy cried.</p>

<p>All the other dolls climbed upon the window sill beside him.</p>

<p>"Scoot me too!" cried the other little penny doll in her squeeky little
voice, and Raggedy Andy took her in his rag hand and gave her a great
swing which sent her scooting down the shiny tin gutter, "Kerswish!"</p>

<p>Then Raggedy Andy climbed into the gutter himself and, taking a few
steps, spread out his feet and went scooting down the shiny tin.</p>

<p>The other dolls followed his example and scooted along behind him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>When Raggedy Andy came to the place where he expected to find the penny
dolls lying, they were nowhere about.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you scooted them farther than you thought!" Uncle Clem said.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I did!" Raggedy Andy said, "We will look around the bend in the
eave!"</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" he exclaimed when he had peeped around the corner of the
roof, "the gutter ends here and there is nothing but a hole!"</p>

<p>"They must have scooted right into the hole," Henny, the Dutch doll
said.</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy lay flat upon the shiny tin and looked down into the hole.</p>

<p>"Are you down there, penny dolls?" he called.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>"I hope their heads were not broken!" Raggedy Ann said.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-048.jpg" width="400" height="332" alt="In the gutter" title="In the gutter" />

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm so sorry I scooted them!" Raggedy Andy cried, as he brushed his
hand over his shoe button eyes.</p>

<p>"Maybe if you hold to my feet, I can reach down the hole and find them
and pull them up again!" he added.</p>

<p>Uncle Clem and Henny each caught hold of a foot of Raggedy Andy and let
him slide down into the hole.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 254px;">
<img src="images/illus-050.jpg" width="254" height="400" alt="Down the spout" title="Down the spout" />
</div>

<p>It was a rather tight fit, but Raggedy Andy wiggled and twisted until
all the dolls could see of him were his two feet.</p>

<p>"I can't find them!" he said in muffled tones. "Let me down farther and
I think I'll be able to reach them!"</p>

<p>Now Henny and Uncle Clem thought that Raggedy Andy meant for them to let
go of his feet and this they did.</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy kept wiggling and twisting until he came to a bend in the
pipe and could go no farther.</p>

<p>"I can't find them!" he cried. "They have gone farther down the pipe!
Now you can pull me up!"</p>

<p>"We can't reach you, Raggedy Andy!" Uncle Clem called down the pipe.
"Try to wiggle back up a piece and we will catch your feet and pull you
up!"</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy tried to wiggle backward up the pipe, but his clothes
caught upon a little piece of tin which stuck out from the inside of the
pipe and there he stayed. He could neither go down nor come back up.</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" Uncle Clem cried, "The folks will never find him
down there, for we can not tell them where he is, and they will never
guess it!"</p>

<p>The dolls were all very sad. They stayed out upon the shiny new tin
gutter until it began raining and hoped and hoped that Raggedy Andy
could get back up to them.</p>

<p>Then they went inside the nursery and sat looking out the window until
it was time for the folks to get up and the house to be astir. Then they
went back to the position each had been in, when Marcella had left them.</p>

<p>And although they were very quiet, each one was so sorry to lose Raggedy
Andy, and each felt that he would never be found again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"The rain must have soaked his cotton through and through!" sighed
Raggedy Ann. "For all the water from the house runs down the shiny tin
gutters and down the pipe into a rain barrel at the bottom!"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 256px;">
<img src="images/illus-052.jpg" width="256" height="400" alt="Raggedy Ann and the dolls" title="Raggedy Ann and the dolls" />
</div><p>Then Raggedy Ann remembered that there was an opening at the bottom of
the pipe.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow night if we have a chance, we dolls must take a stick and see
if we can reach Raggedy Andy from the bottom of the pipe and pull him
down to us!" she thought.</p>

<p>Marcella came up to the nursery and played all day, watching the rain
patter upon the new tin gutter. She wondered where Raggedy Andy was,
although she did not get worried about him until she had asked Mama
where he might be.</p>

<p>"He must be just where you left him!" Mama said.</p>

<p>"I cannot remember where I left him!" Marcella said.</p>

<p>"I thought he was with all the other dolls in the nursery, though!"</p>

<p>All day Sunday it rained and all of Sunday night, and Monday morning
when Daddy started to work it was still raining.</p>

<p>As Daddy walked out of the front gate, he turned to wave good-bye to
Mama and Marcella and then he saw something.</p>

<p>Daddy came right back into the house and called up the men who had put
in the new shiny tin gutters.</p>

<p>"The drain pipe is plugged up. Some of you must have left shavings or
something in the eaves, and it has washed down into the pipe, so that
the water pours over the gutter in sheets!"</p>

<p>"We will send a man right up to fix it!" the men said.</p>

<p>So along about ten o'clock that morning one of the men came to fix the
pipe.</p>

<p>But although he punched a long pole down the pipe, and punched and
punched, he could not dislodge whatever it was which plugged the pipe
and kept the water from running through it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<img src="images/illus-053.jpg" width="400" height="262" alt="The man finds Raggedy Andy" title="The man finds Raggedy Andy" />
</div>

<p>Then the man measured with his stick, so that he knew just where the
place was, and with a pair of tin shears he cut a section from the pipe
and found Raggedy Andy.</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy was punched quite out of shape and all jammed together, but
when the man straightened out the funny little figure, Raggedy Andy
looked up at him with his customary happy smile.</p>

<p>The man laughed and carried little water-soaked Raggedy Andy into the
house.</p>

<p>"I guess your little girl must have dropped this rag doll down into the
drain pipe!" the man said to Mama.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad you found him!" Mama said to the man.</p>

<p>"We have hunted all over the house for him! Marcella could not remember
where she put him; so when I get him nice and dry, I'll hide him in a
nice easy place for her to find, and she will not know he has been out
in the rain all night!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-054.jpg" width="400" height="359" alt="Raggedy Andy sitting" title="Raggedy Andy sitting" />
</div>

<p>So Mama put Raggedy Andy behind the radiator and there he sat all
afternoon, steaming and drying out.</p>

<p>And as he sat there he smiled and smiled, even though there was no one
to see him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>He felt very happy within and he liked to smile, anyway, because his
smile was painted on.</p>

<p>And another reason Raggedy Andy smiled was because he was not lonesome.</p>

<p>Inside his waist were the two little penny dolls.</p>

<p>The man had punched Raggedy Andy farther down into the pipe, and he had
been able to reach the two little dolls and tuck them into a safe place.</p>

<p>"Won't they all be surprised to see us back again!" Raggedy Andy
whispered as he patted the two little penny dolls with his soft rag
hands.</p>

<p>And the two little penny dolls nestled against Raggedy Andy's soft
cotton stuffed body, and thought how nice it was to have such a happy,
sunny friend.</p>

<h2><a name="DOCTOR_RAGGEDY_ANDY" id="DOCTOR_RAGGEDY_ANDY"></a>DOCTOR RAGGEDY ANDY</h2>


<p>Raggedy Andy, Raggedy Ann, Uncle Clem and Henny were not given medicine.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 258px;">
<img src="images/illus-055.jpg" width="258" height="400" alt="Medicine" title="Medicine" />
</div>

<p>Because, you see, they had no mouths.</p>

<p>That is, mouths through which medicine could be poured.</p>

<p>Their mouths were either painted on, or were sewed on with yarn.</p>

<p>Sometimes the medicine spoon would be touched to their faces but none of
the liquid be given them. Except accidentally.</p>

<p>But the French doll had a lovely mouth for taking medicine; it was open
and showed her teeth in a dimpling smile.</p>

<p>She also had soft brown eyes which opened and closed when she was tilted
backward or forward.</p>

<p>The medicine which was given the dolls had great curing properties.</p>

<p>It would cure the most stubborn case of croup, measles, whooping cough
or any other ailment the dolls had wished upon them by their little
Mistress.</p>

<p>Some days all the dolls would be put to bed with "measles" but in the
course of half an hour they would have every other ailment in the Doctor
book.</p>

<p>The dolls enjoyed it very much, for, you see, Marcella always tried the
medicine first to see if it was strong enough before she gave any to the
dolls.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>



<p>So the dolls really did not get as much of the medicine as their little
mistress.</p>

<p>The wonderful remedy was made from a very old recipe handed down from
ancient times.</p>

<p>This recipe is guaranteed to cure every ill a doll may have.</p>

<p>The medicine was made from brown sugar and water. Perhaps you may have
used it for your dollies.</p>

<p>The medicine was also used as "tea" and "soda water," except when the
dolls were supposed to be ill.</p>

<p>Having nothing but painted or yarn mouths, the ailments of Raggedy Andy,
Raggedy Ann, Uncle Clem and Henny, the Dutch doll, mostly consisted of
sprained wrists, arms and legs, or perhaps a headache and a toothache.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-057.jpg" width="400" height="267" alt="Bandaged up" title="Bandaged up" />
</div>

<p>None of them knew they had the trouble until Marcella had wrapped up the
"injured" rag arm, leg or head, and had explained in detail just what
was the matter.</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy, Raggedy Ann, Uncle Clem, or Henny were just as happy with
their heads tied up for the toothache as they were without their heads
tied up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>Not having teeth, naturally they could not have the toothache, and if
they could furnish amusement for Marcella by having her pretend they had
the toothache, then that made them very happy.</p>

<p>So this day, the French doll was quite ill. She started out with the
"croup," and went through the "measles," "whooping cough," and "yellow
fever" in an hour.</p>

<p>The attack came on quite suddenly.</p>

<p>The French doll was sitting quietly in one of the little red chairs,
smiling the prettiest of dimpling smiles at Raggedy Andy, and thinking
of the romp the dolls would have that night after the house grew quiet,
when Marcella discovered that the French doll had the "croup" and put
her to bed.</p>

<p>The French doll closed her eyes when put to bed, but the rest of her
face did not change expression. She still wore her happy smile.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-058.jpg" width="400" height="333" alt="Marcella caring for the sick" title="Marcella caring for the sick" />
</div>
<p>Marcella mixed the medicine very "strong" and poured it into the French
doll's open mouth.</p>

<p>She was given a "dose" every minute or so.</p>

<p>It was during the "yellow fever" stage that Marcella was called to
supper and left the dolls in the nursery alone.</p>

<p>Marcella did not play with them again that evening; so the dolls all
remained in the same position until Marcella and the rest of the folks
went to bed.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 254px;">
<img src="images/illus-060.jpg" width="254" height="400" alt="Raggedy Andy winds the music box" title="Raggedy Andy winds the music box" />
</div>

<p>Then Raggedy Andy jumped from his chair and wound up the little music
box. "Let's start with a lively dance!" he cried.</p>

<p>When the music started tinkling he caught the French doll's hand, and
danced 'way across the nursery floor before he discovered that her soft
brown eyes remained closed as they were when she lay upon the "sick"
bed.</p>

<p>All the dolls gathered around Raggedy Andy and the French doll.</p>

<p>"I can't open my eyes!" she said.</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy tried to open the French doll's eyes with his soft rag
hands, but it was no use.</p>

<p>They shook her. This sometimes has the desired effect when dolls do not
open their eyes.</p>

<p>They shook her again and again. It was no use, her eyes remained closed.</p>

<p>"It must be the sticky, sugary 'medicine'!" said Uncle Clem.</p>

<p>"I really believe it must be!" the French doll replied. "The 'medicine'
seemed to settle in the back of my head when I was lying down, and I can
still feel it back there!"</p>

<p>"That must be it, and now it has hardened and keeps your pretty eyes
from working!" said Raggedy Ann. "What shall we do?"</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy and Raggedy Ann walked over to a corner of the nursery and
thought and thought. They pulled their foreheads down into wrinkles with
their hands, so that they might think harder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 254px;">
<img src="images/illus-062.jpg" width="254" height="400" alt="Holding the French doll upside down" title="Holding the French doll upside down" />
</div>

<p>Finally Raggedy Ann cried, "I've thought of a plan!" and went skipping
from the corner out to where the other dolls sat about the French doll.</p>

<p>"We must stand her upon her head, then the 'medicine' will run up into
her hair, for there is a hole in the top of her head. I remember seeing
it when her hair came off one time!"</p>

<p>"No sooner said than done!" cried Uncle Clem, as he took the French doll
by the waist and stood her upon her head.</p>

<p>"That should be long enough!" Raggedy Ann said, when Uncle Clem had held
the French doll in this position for five minutes.</p>

<p>But when the French doll was again placed upon her feet her eyes still
remained tightly closed.</p>

<p>All this time, Raggedy Andy had remained in the corner, thinking as hard
as his rag head would think.</p>

<p>He thought and thought, until the yarn hair upon his head stood up in
the air and wiggled.</p>

<p>"If the 'medicine' did not run up into her hair when she stood upon her
head," thought Raggedy Andy, "then it is because the 'medicine' could
not run; so, if the medicine can not run, it is because it is too sticky
and thick to run out the hole in the top of her head." He also thought a
lot more.</p>

<p>At last he turned to the others and said out loud, "I can't seem to
think of a single way to help her open her eyes unless we take off her
hair and wash the medicine from inside her china head."</p>

<p>"Why didn't I think of that?" Raggedy Ann asked. "That is just the way
we shall have to do!"</p>



<p>So Raggedy Ann caught hold of the French doll's feet, and Raggedy Andy
caught hold of the French doll's lively curls, and they pulled and they
pulled.</p>

<p>Then the other dolls caught hold of Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy and
pulled and pulled, until finally, with a sharp "R-R-Rip!" the French
doll's hair came off, and the dolls who were pulling went tumbling over
backwards.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

</div>
<p>Laughingly they scrambled to their feet and sat the French doll up, so
they might look into the hole in the top of her head.</p>

<p>Yes, the sticky "medicine" had grown hard and would not let the French
doll's eyes open.</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy put his hand inside and pushed on the eyes so that they
opened.</p>

<p>This was all right, only now the eyes would not close when the French
doll lay down. She tried it.</p>

<p>So Raggedy Andy ran down into the kitchen and brought up a small tin cup
full of warm water and a tiny rag.</p>

<p>With these he loosened the sticky "medicine" and washed the inside of
the French doll's head nice and clean.</p>

<p>There were lots of cooky and cracker crumbs inside her head, too.</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy washed it all nice and clean, and then wet the glue which
made the pretty curls stay on.</p>

<p>So when her hair was placed upon her head again, the French doll was as
good as new.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you all very much!" she said, as she tilted backwards and
forwards, and found that her eyes worked very easily.</p>

</div>

<p>Raggedy Andy again wound up the little music box and, catching the
French doll about the waist, started a rollicking dance which lasted
until the roosters in the neighborhood began their morning crowing.</p>

<p>Then, knowing the folks might soon be astir, the dolls left off their
playing, and all took the same positions they had been in when Marcella
left them the night before.</p>

<p>And so Marcella found them.</p>

<p>The French doll was in bed with her eyes closed, and her happy dimpling
smile lighting up her pretty face.</p>

<p>And to this day, the dollies' little mistress does not know that Raggedy
Andy was the doctor who cured the French doll of her only ill.</p>

<h2><a name="RAGGEDY_ANDYS_SMILE" id="RAGGEDY_ANDYS_SMILE"></a>RAGGEDY ANDY'S SMILE</h2>


<p>Raggedy Andy's smile was gone.</p>

<p>Not entirely, but enough so that it made his face seem onesided.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 255px;">
<img src="images/illus-065.jpg" width="255" height="400" alt="Dickie and Raggedy Andy" title="Dickie and Raggedy Andy" />
</div>
<p>If one viewed Raggedy Andy from the left side, one could see his smile.</p>

<p>But if one looked at Raggedy Andy from the right side, one could not see
his smile. So Raggedy Andy's smile was gone.</p>

<p>It really was not Raggedy Andy's fault.</p>

<p>He felt just as happy and sunny as ever.</p>

<p>And perhaps would not have known the difference had not the other dolls
told him he had only one half of his cheery smile left.</p>

<p>Nor was it Marcella's fault. How was she to know that Dickie would feed
Raggedy Andy orange juice and take off most of his smile?</p>

<p>And besides taking off one half of Raggedy Andy's smile, the orange
juice left a great brown stain upon his face.</p>

<p>Marcella was very sorry when she saw what Dickie had done.</p>

<p>Dickie would have been sorry, too, if he had been more than two years
old, but when one is only two years old, he has very few sorrows.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>Dickie's only sorrow was that Raggedy Andy was taken from him, and he
could not feed Raggedy Andy more orange juice.</p>

<p>Marcella kissed Raggedy Andy more than she did the rest of the dolls
that night, when she put them to bed, and this made all the dolls very
happy.</p>

<p>It always gave them great pleasure when any of their number was hugged
and kissed, for there was not a selfish doll among them.</p>

<p>Marcella hung up a tiny stocking for each of the dollies, and placed a
tiny little china dish for each of the penny dolls beside their little
spool box bed.</p>

<p>For, as you probably have guessed, it was Christmas eve, and Marcella
was in hopes Santa Claus would see the tiny stockings and place
something in them for each dollie.</p>

<p>Then when the house was very quiet, the French doll told Raggedy Andy
that most of his smile was gone.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Raggedy Andy. "I can still feel it! It must be there!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but it really is gone!" Uncle Clem said. "It was the orange juice!"</p>

<p>"Well, I still feel just as happy," said Raggedy Andy, "so let's have a
jolly game of some sort! What shall it be?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 254px;">
<img src="images/illus-068.jpg" width="254" height="400" alt="Raggedy Andy&#39;s lopsided smile" title="Raggedy Andy&#39;s lopsided smile" />
</div>

<p>"Perhaps we had best try to wash your face!" said practical Raggedy Ann.
She always acted as a mother to the other dolls when they were alone.</p>

<p>"It will not do a bit of good!" the French doll told Raggedy Ann, "for I
remember I had orange juice spilled upon a nice white frock I had one
time, and the stain would never come out!"</p>

<p>"That is too bad!" Henny, the Dutch doll, said. "We shall miss Raggedy
Andy's cheery smile when he is looking straight at us!"</p>

<p>"You will have to stand on my right side, when you wish to see my
smile!" said Raggedy Andy, with a cheery little chuckle 'way down in his
soft cotton inside.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>


<p>"But I wish everyone to understand," he went on, "that I am smiling just
the same, whether you can see it or not!"</p>

<p>And with this, Raggedy Andy caught hold of Uncle Clem and Henny, and
made a dash for the nursery door, followed by all the other dolls.</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy intended jumping down the stairs, head over heels, for he
knew that neither he, Uncle Clem nor Henny would break anything by
jumping down stairs.</p>

<p>But just as they got almost to the door, they dropped to the floor in a
heap, for there, standing watching the whole performance, was a man.</p>

<p>All the dolls fell in different attitudes, for it would never do for
them to let a real person see that they could act and talk just like
real people.</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy, Uncle Clem and Henny stopped so suddenly they fell over
each other and Raggedy Andy, being in the lead and pulling the other
two, slid right through the door and stopped at the feet of the man.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-069.jpg" width="400" height="265" alt="Santa" title="Santa" />
</div>

<p>A cheery laugh greeted this and a chubby hand reached down and picked up
Raggedy Andy and turned him over.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>Raggedy Andy looked up into a cheery little round face, with a little
red nose and red cheeks, and all framed in white whiskers which looked
just like snow.</p>

<p>Then the little round man walked into the nursery and picked up all the
dolls and looked at them. He made no noise when he walked, and this was
why he had taken the dolls by surprise at the head of the stairs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus-070.jpg" width="400" height="333" alt="Santa repairs Raggedy Andy" title="Santa repairs Raggedy Andy" />
</div>

<p>The little man with the snow-white whiskers placed all the dolls in a
row and from a little case in his pocket he took a tiny bottle and a
little brush. He dipped the little brush in the tiny bottle and touched
all the dolls' faces with it.</p>

<p>He had purposely saved Raggedy Andy's face until the last. Then, as all
the dolls watched, the cheery little white-whiskered man touched Raggedy
Andy's face with the magic liquid, and the orange juice stain
disappeared, and in its place came Raggedy Andy's rosy cheeks and cheery
smile.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>And, turning Raggedy Andy so that he could face all the other dolls, the
cheery little man showed him that all the other dolls had new rosy
cheeks and newly-painted faces. They all looked just like new dollies.
Even Susan's cracked head had been made whole.</p>

<p>Henny, the Dutch doll, was so surprised he fell over backward and said,
"Squeek!"</p>

<p>When the cheery little man with the white whiskers heard this, he picked
Henny up and touched him with the paint brush in the center of the back,
just above the place where Henny had the little mechanism which made him
say "Mama" when he was new. And when the little man touched Henny and
tipped him forward and backward, Henny was just as good as new and said
"Mama" very prettily.</p>

<p>Then the little man put something in each of the tiny doll stockings,
and something in each of the little china plates for the two penny
dolls.</p>

<p>Then, as quietly as he had entered, he left, merely turning at the door
and shaking his finger at the dolls in a cheery, mischievous manner.</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy heard him chuckling to himself as he went down the stairs.</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy tiptoed to the door and over to the head of the stairs.</p>

<p>Then he motioned for the other dolls to come.</p>

<p>There, from the head of the stairs, they watched the cheery little
white-whiskered man take pretty things from a large sack and place them
about the chimneyplace.</p>

<p>"He does not know that we are watching him," the dolls all thought, but
when the little man had finished his task, he turned quickly and laughed
right up at the dolls, for he had known that they were watching him all
the time.</p>

<p>Then, again shaking his finger at them in his cheery manner, the little
white-whiskered man swung the sack to his shoulder, and with a whistle
such as the wind makes <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>when it plays through the chinks of a window, he
was gone&mdash;up the chimney.</p>

<p>The dolls were very quiet as they walked back into the nursery and sat
down to think it all over, and as they sat there thinking, they heard
out in the night the "tinkle, tinkle, tinkle" of tiny sleigh bells,
growing fainter and fainter as they disappeared in the distance.</p>

</div>

<p>Without a word, but filled with a happy wonder, the dolls climbed into
their beds, just as Marcella had left them, and pulled the covers up to
their chins.</p>

<p>And Raggedy Andy lay there, his little shoe button eyes looking straight
towards the ceiling and smiling a joyful smile&mdash;not a "half smile" this
time, but a "full size smile."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_WOODEN_HORSE" id="THE_WOODEN_HORSE"></a>THE WOODEN HORSE</h2>


<p>Santa Claus left a whole lot of toys.</p>




<p>A wooden horse, covered with canton flannel and touched lightly with a
paint brush dipped in black paint to give him a dappled gray appearance,
was one of the presents.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 256px;">
<img src="images/illus-073.jpg" width="256" height="400" alt="Raggedy Andy and the Wooden Horse" title="Raggedy Andy and the Wooden Horse" />
</div>

<p>With the wooden horse came a beautiful red wagon with four yellow
wheels. My! The paint was pretty and shiny.</p>

<p>The wooden horse was hitched to the wagon with a patent leather harness;
and he, himself, stood proudly upon a red platform running on four
little nickel wheels.</p>

<p>It was true that the wooden horse's eyes were as far apart as a camel's
and made him look quite like one when viewed from in front, but he had
soft leather ears and a silken mane and tail.</p>

<p>He was nice to look upon, was the wooden horse. All the dolls patted him
and smoothed his silken mane and felt his shiny patent leather harness
the first night they were alone with him in the nursery.</p>

<p>The wooden horse had a queer voice; the dolls could hardly understand
him at first, but when his bashfulness wore off, he talked quite
plainly.</p>

<p>"It is the first time I have ever tried to talk," he explained when he
became acquainted, "and I guess I was talking down in my stomach instead
of my head!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will like it here in the nursery very much!" said Raggedy Andy. "We
have such jolly times and love each other so much I know you will enjoy
your new home!"</p>

<p>"I am sure I shall!" the wooden horse answered. "Where I came from,
we&mdash;the other horses and myself&mdash;just stood silently upon the shelves
and looked and looked straight ahead, and never so much as moved our
tails."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 255px;">
<img src="images/illus-076.jpg" width="255" height="400" alt="The wooden horse rolled over Raggedy Ann&#39;s foot" title="The wooden horse rolled over Raggedy Ann&#39;s foot" />
</div>

<p>"See if you can move your tail now!" Henny, the Dutch doll, suggested.</p>

<p>The wooden horse started to roll across the nursery floor and if Raggedy
Ann had not been in the way, he might have bumped into the wall. As it
was, the wooden horse rolled against Raggedy Ann and upset her but could
go no further when his wheels ran against her rag foot.</p>

<p>When the wooden horse upset Raggedy Ann, he stood still until Uncle Clem
and Henny and Raggedy Andy lifted him off Raggedy Ann's feet. "Did I
frisk my tail?" he asked when Raggedy Ann stood up and smoothed her
apron.</p>

<p>"Try it again!" said Raggedy Ann. "I couldn't see!" She laughed her
cheery rag doll laugh, for Raggedy Ann, no matter what happened, never
lost her temper.</p>

<p>The wooden horse started rolling backward at this and knocked Henny over
upon his back, causing him to cry "Mama!" in his squeeky voice.</p>

<p>Uncle Clem, Raggedy Ann, and the tin soldier all held to the wooden
horse and managed to stop him just as he was backing out of the nursery
door towards the head of the stairs.</p>

<p>Then the dolls pulled the wooden horse back to the center of the room.
"It's funny" he said, "that I start moving backward or forward when I
try to frisk my tail!"</p>

<p>"I believe it is because you have stood so long upon the shelf without
moving," Raggedy Andy suggested. "Suppose you try moving forward!"</p>

<p>Uncle Clem, who was standing in front of the wooden horse, jumped to one
side so hastily his feet slipped out from under him, just as if he had
been sliding upon slippery ice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>The wooden horse did not start moving forward as Uncle Clem had
expected; instead, his silken tail frisked gaily up over his back.</p>

<p>"Whee! There, you frisked your tail!" cried all the dolls as joyfully as
if the wooden horse had done something truly wonderful.</p>

<p>"It's easy now!" said the wooden horse. "When I wish to go forward or
backward I'll try to frisk my tail and then I'll roll along on my shiny
wheels; then when I wish to frisk my tail I'll try to roll forward or
backward, like this!" But instead of rolling forward, the wooden horse
frisked his tail. "I wanted to frisk my tail then!" he said in surprise.
"Now I'll roll forward!" And sure enough, the wooden horse rolled across
the nursery floor.</p>

<img src="images/illus-078.jpg" width="400" height="333" alt="The wooden horse pulls a cart" title="The wooden horse pulls a cart" />
</div>

<p>When he started rolling upon his shiny wheels, Raggedy Andy cried, "All
aboard!" and, taking a short run, he leaped upon the wooden horse's
back. Uncle Clem, Raggedy Ann, Henny, the Dutch doll and Susan, the doll
without a head, all scrambled up into the pretty red wagon.</p>

<p>The wooden horse thought this was great fun and round <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>and round the
nursery he circled. His shiny wheels and the pretty yellow wheels of the
red wagon creaked so loudly none of the dolls heard the cries of the
tiny penny dolls who were too small to climb aboard. Finally, as the
wagon load of dolls passed the penny dolls, Raggedy Andy noticed the two
little midgets standing together and missing the fun; so, leaning 'way
over to one side as the horse swept by them, Raggedy Andy caught both
the penny dolls in his strong rag arms and lifted them to a seat upon
the broad back of the wooden horse.</p>

<p>"Hooray!" cried all the dolls when they saw Raggedy Andy's feat. "It was
just like a Wild West Show!"</p>

<p>"We must all have all the fun we can together!" said Raggedy Andy.</p>

<p>"Good for you!" cried Uncle Clem. "The more fun we can give each other,
the more fun each one of us will have!"</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>


<p>The wooden horse made the circle of the nursery a great many times, for
it pleased him very much to hear the gay laughter of the dolls and he
thought to himself, "How happy I will be, living with such a jolly
crowd."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

</div>

<p>But just as he was about to pass the door, there was a noise upon the
stairs and the wooden horse, hearing it, stopped so suddenly Raggedy
Andy and the penny dolls went clear over his head and the dolls in the
front of the wagon took Raggedy Andy's seat upon the horse's back.</p>

<p>They lay just as they fell, for they did not wish anyone to suspect that
they could move or talk.</p>

<p>"Ha! Ha! Ha! I knew you were having a lot of fun!" cried a cheery voice.</p>

<p>At this, all the dolls immediately scrambled back into their former
places, for they recognized the voice of the French dollie.</p>

<p>But what was their surprise to see her dressed in a lovely fairy
costume, her lovely curls flying out behind, as she ran towards them.</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy was just about to climb upon the horse's <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>back again when
the French doll leaped there herself and, balancing lightly upon one
foot, stood in this position while the wooden horse rolled around the
nursery as fast as he could go.</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy and the two penny dolls ran after the wagon and, with the
assistance of Uncle Clem and Raggedy Ann, climbed up in back.</p>

<p>When the wooden horse finally stopped the dolls all said, "This is the
most fun we have had for a <i>long</i> time!"</p>

<p>The wooden horse, a thrill of happiness running through his wooden body,
cried, "It is the most fun I have <i>ever</i> had!"</p>

<p>And the dolls, while they did not tell him so, knew that he had had the
most fun because he had given <i>them</i> the most pleasure.</p>

<p>For, as you must surely know, they who are the most unselfish are the
ones who gain the greatest joy; because they give happiness to others.</p>

<p>"Whee! It's good to be back home again!" said Raggedy Andy to the other
dolls, as he stretched his feet out in front of the little toy stove and
rubbed his rag hands briskly together, as if to warm them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 256px;">

<p>All the dolls laughed at Raggedy Andy for doing this, for they knew
there had never been a fire in the little toy stove in all the time it
had been in the nursery. And that was a long time.</p>

<p>"We are so glad and happy to have you back home again with us!" the
dolls told Raggedy Andy. "For we have missed you very, very much!"</p>

<p>"Well," Raggedy Andy replied, as he held his rag hands over the tiny lid
of the stove and rubbed them again, "I have missed all of you, too, and
wished many times that you had been with me to join in and share in the
pleasures and frolics I've had."</p>

<p>And as Raggedy Andy continued to hold his hands over the little stove,
Uncle Clem asked him why he did it.</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy smiled and leaned back in his chair. "Really," he said, "I
wasn't paying any attention to what I was doing! I've spent so much of
my time while I was away drying out my soft cotton stuffing it seems as
though it has almost become a habit."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Were you wet most of the time, Raggedy Andy?" the French doll asked.</p>

<p>"Nearly all the time!" Raggedy Andy replied. "First I would get sopping
wet and then I'd freeze!"</p>

<p>"Freeze!" exclaimed all the dolls in one breath.</p>

<p>"Dear me, yes!" Raggedy Andy laughed. "Just see here!" And Raggedy Andy
pulled his sleeve up and showed where his rag arm had been mended. "That
was quite a rip!" he smiled.</p>

<p>"Dear! Dear! How in the world did it happen? On a nail?" Henny, the
Dutch doll, asked as he put his arm about Raggedy Andy.</p>

<p>"Froze!" said Raggedy Andy.</p>

<p>The dolls gathered around Raggedy Andy and examined the rip in his rag
arm.</p>

<p>"It's all right now!" he laughed. "But you should have seen me when it
happened! I was frozen into one solid cake of ice all the way through,
and when Marcella tried to limber up my arm before it had thawed out, it
went, 'Pop!' and just bursted.</p>

<p>"Then I was placed in a pan of nice warm water until the icy cotton
inside me had melted, and then I was hung up on a line above the kitchen
stove, out at Gran'ma's."</p>

<p>"But how did you happen to get so wet and then freeze?" asked Raggedy
Ann.</p>



<p>"Out across the road from Gran'ma's home, 'way out in the country, there
is a lovely pond," Raggedy Andy explained. "In the summer time pretty
flowers grow about the edge, the little green frogs sit upon the pond
lilies and beat upon their tiny drums all through the night, and the
twinkling stars wink at their reflections in the smooth water. But when
Marcella and I went out to Gran'ma's, last week, Gran'ma met us with a
sleigh, for the ground was covered with starry snow. The pretty pond was
covered with ice, too, and upon the ice was a soft blanket of the white,
white snow. It was beautiful!" said Raggedy Andy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>"Gran'ma had a lovely new sled for Marcella, a red one with shiny
runners.</p>

<p>"And after we had visited Gran'ma a while, we went to the pond for a
slide.</p>

<p>"It was heaps of fun, for there was a little hill at one end of the pond
so that when we coasted down, we went scooting across the pond like an
arrow.</p>

<p>"Marcella would turn the sled sideways, just for fun, and she and I
would fall off and go sliding across the ice upon our backs, leaving a
clean path of ice, where we pushed aside the snow as we slid. Then
Marcella showed me how to make 'angels' in the soft snow!"</p>

<p>"Oh, tell us how, Raggedy Andy!" shouted all the dollies.</p>

<p>"It's very easy!" said Raggedy Andy. "Marcella would lie down upon her
back in the snow and put her hands back up over her head, then she would
bring her hands in a circle down to her sides, like this." And Raggedy
Andy lay upon the floor of the nursery and showed the dollies just how
it was done. "Then," he added, "when she stood up it would leave the
print of her body and legs in the white, white snow, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>and where she had
swooped her arms there were the 'angel's wings!'"</p>

<p>"It must have looked just like an angel!" said Uncle Clem.</p>

<p>"Indeed it was very pretty!" Raggedy Andy answered. "Then Marcella made
a lot of 'angels' by placing me in the snow and working my arms; so you
see, what with falling off the sled so much and making so many 'angels,'
we both were wet, but I was completely soaked through. My cotton just
became soppy and I was ever so much heavier! Then Gran'ma, just as we
were having a most delightful time, came to the door and 'Ooh-hooed' to
Marcella to come and get a nice new doughnut. So Marcella, thinking to
return in a minute, left me lying upon the sled and ran through the snow
to Gran'ma's. And there I stayed and stayed until I began to feel stiff
and could hear the cotton inside me go, 'Tic! Tic!' as it began to
freeze.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>"I lay upon the sled until after the sun went down. Two little Chicadees
came and sat upon the sled and talked to me in their cute little bird
language, and I watched the sky in the west get golden red, then turn
into a deep crimson purple and finally a deep blue, as the sun went
farther down around the bend of the earth. After it had been dark for
some time, I heard someone coming through the snow and could see the
yellow light of a lantern. It was Gran'ma.</p>

<p>"She pulled the sled over in back of her house and did not see that I
was upon it until she turned to go in the kitchen; then she picked me up
and took me inside. 'He's frozen as stiff as a board!' she told Marcella
as she handed me to her. Marcella did not say why she had forgotten to
come for me, but I found out afterward that it was because she was so
wet. Gran'ma made her change her clothes and shoes and stockings and
would not permit her to go out and play again.</p>

<p>"Well, anyway," concluded Raggedy Andy, "Marcella tried to limber my arm
and, being almost solid ice, it just burst. And that is the way it went
all the time we were out at Gran'ma's; I was wet nearly all the time.
But I wish you could all have been with me to share in the fun."</p>

</div>

<p>And Raggedy Andy again leaned over the little toy stove and rubbed his
rag hands briskly together.</p>

<p>Uncle Clem went to the waste paper basket and came back with some scraps
of yellow and red paper. Then, taking off one of the tiny lids, he
stuffed the paper in part of the way as if the flames were "shooting
up!"</p>

<p>Then, as all the dolls' merry laughter rang out, Raggedy Andy stopped
rubbing his hands, and catching Raggedy Ann about the waist, he went
skipping across the nursery floor with her, whirling so fast neither saw
they had gone out through the door until it was too late. For coming to
the head of the stairs, they both went head over heels, "blumpity,
blump!" over and over, until they wound up, laughing, at the bottom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Last one up is a Cocoa baby!" cried Raggedy Ann, as she scrambled to
her feet. And with her skirts in her rag hands she went racing up the
stairs to where the rest of the dollies stood laughing.</p>

<p>"Hurrah, for Raggedy Ann!" cried Raggedy Andy generously. "She won!"</p>

</div>




<h2><a name="THE_SINGING_SHELL" id="THE_SINGING_SHELL"></a>THE SINGING SHELL</h2>


<p>For years and years the beautiful shell had been upon the floor in
Gran'ma's front room. It was a large shell with many points upon it.
These were coarse and rough, but the shell was most beautiful inside.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 257px;">
<img src="images/illus-089.jpg" width="257" height="400" alt="Listening to the seashell" title="Listening to the seashell" />
</div>

<p>Marcella had seen the shell time and time again and often admired its
lovely coloring, which could be seen when one looked inside the shell.</p>

<p>So one day, Gran'ma gave the beautiful shell to Marcella to have for her
very own, up in the nursery.</p>

<p>"It will be nice to place before the nursery door so the wind will not
blow the door to and pinch anyone's fingers!" Gran'ma laughed.</p>

<p>So Marcella brought the shell home and placed it in front of the nursery
door. Here the dolls saw it that night, when all the house was still,
and stood about it wondering what kind of toy it might be.</p>

<p>"It seems to be nearly all mouth!" said Henny, the Dutch doll. "Perhaps
it can talk."</p>

<p>"It has teeth!" the French doll pointed out. "It may bite!"</p>

<p>"I do not believe it will bite," Raggedy Andy mused, as he got down upon
his hands and knees and looked up into the shell. "Marcella would not
have it up here if it would bite!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> And, saying this, Raggedy Andy put
his rag arm into the lovely shell's mouth.</p>

<p>"It doesn't bite! I knew it wouldn't!" he cried. "Just feel how smooth
it is inside!"</p>

<p>All the dolls felt and were surprised to find it polished so highly
inside, while the outside was so coarse and rough. With the help of
Uncle Clem and Henny, Raggedy Andy turned the shell upon its back, so
that all the dolls might look in.</p>

<p>The coloring consisted of dainty pinks, creamy whites and pale blues,
all running together just as the coloring in an opal runs from one shade
into another. Raggedy Andy, stooping over to look further up inside the
pretty shell, heard something.</p>

<p>"It's whispering!" he said, as he raised up in surprise.</p>

<p>All the dolls took turns putting their ears to the mouth of the
beautiful shell. Yes, truly it whispered, but they could not catch just
what it said.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 254px;">
<img src="images/illus-092.jpg" width="254" height="400" alt="Everyone listens" title="Everyone listens" />
</div>

<p>Finally Raggedy Andy suggested that all the dolls lie down upon the
floor directly before the shell and keep very quiet.</p>

<p>"If we don't make a sound we may be able to hear what it says!" he
explained.</p>

<p>So the dolls lay down, placing themselves flat upon the floor directly
in front of the shell and where they could see and admire its beautiful
coloring.</p>

<p>Now the dolls could be very, very quiet when they really wished to be,
and it was easy for them to hear the faint whispering of the shell.</p>

<p>This is the story the shell told the dolls in the nursery that night:</p>

<p>"A long, long time ago, I lived upon the yellow sand, deep down beneath
the blue, blue waters of the ocean. Pretty silken sea weeds grew around
my home and reached their waving branches up, up towards the top of the
water.</p>


<p>"Through the pretty sea weeds, fishes of pretty colors and shapes darted
here and there, playing at their games.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was still and quiet 'way down where I lived, for even if the ocean
roared and pounded itself into an angry mass of tumbling waves up above,
this never disturbed the calm waters down where I lived.</p>

<p>"Many times, little fishes or other tiny sea people came and hid within
my pretty house when they were being pursued by larger sea creatures.
And it always made me very happy to give them this protection.</p>

<p>"They would stay inside until I whispered that the larger creature had
gone, then they would leave me and return to their play.</p>

<p>"Pretty little sea horses with slender, curving bodies often went
sailing above me, or would come to rest upon my back. It was nice to lie
and watch the tiny things curl their little tails about the sea weed and
talk together, for the sea horses like one another and are gentle and
kind to each other, sharing their food happily and smoothing their
little ones with their cunning noses.</p>

<p>"But one day a diver leaped over the side of a boat and came swimming
head-first down, down to where I lay. My! How the tiny sea creatures
scurried to hide from him. He took me within his hand and, giving his
feet a thump upon the yellow sand, rose with me to the surface.</p>

<p>"He poured the water from me, and out came all the little creatures who
had been hiding there!"</p>

<p>Raggedy Andy wiggled upon the floor, he was so interested.</p>

<p>"Did the tiny creatures get back into the water safely?" he asked the
beautiful shell.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" the shell whispered in reply. "The man held me over the side
of the boat, so the tiny creatures went safely back into the water!"</p>

<p>"I am so glad!" Raggedy Andy said, with a sigh of relief. "He must have
been a kindly man!"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" the beautiful shell replied. "So I was placed along with
a lot of other shells in the bottom of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>boat and every once in a
while another shell was placed amongst us. We whispered together and
wondered where we were going. We were finally sold to different people
and I have been at Gran'ma's house for a long, long time."</p>

<p>"You lived there when Gran'ma was a little girl, didn't you?" Raggedy
Ann asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the shell, "I have lived there ever since Gran'ma was a
little girl. She often used to play with me and listen to me sing."</p>

<p>"Raggedy Ann can play 'Peter, Peter, Pumpkin Eater' on the piano, with
one hand," said Uncle Clem, "but none of us can sing. Will you sing for
us?" he asked the shell.</p>

<p>"I sing all the time," the shell replied, "for I cannot help singing,
but my singing is a secret and so is very soft and low. Put your head
close to the opening in my shell and listen!"</p>

<p>The dolls took turns doing this, and heard the shell sing softly and
very sweetly.</p>

<p>"How strange and far away it sounds!" exclaimed the French doll. "Like
fairies singing in the distance! The shell must be singing the songs of
the mermaids and the water-fairies!"</p>

<p>"It is queer that anything so rough on the outside could be so pretty
within!" said Raggedy Andy. "It must be a great pleasure to be able to
sing so sweetly!"</p>

<p>"Indeed it is," replied the beautiful shell, "and I get a great
happiness from singing all the time."</p>

<p>"And you will bring lots of pleasure to us, by being so happy!" said
Raggedy Andy. "For although you may not enter into our games, we will
always know that you are happily singing, and that will make us all
happy!"</p>

<p>"I will tell you the secret of my singing," said the shell. "When anyone
puts his ear to me and listens, he hears the reflection of his own
heart's music, singing; so, you see, while I say that I am singing all
the time, in reality I sing only when someone full of happiness hears
his own singing as if it were mine."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"How unselfish you are to say this!" said Raggedy Andy. "Now we are ever
so much more glad to have you with us. Aren't we?" he asked, turning to
the rest of the dolls.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" came the answer from all the dolls, even the tiny penny
dolls.</p>

<p>"That is why the shell is so beautiful inside!" said Raggedy Ann. "Those
who are unselfish may wear rough clothes, but inside they are always
beautiful, just like the shell, and reflect to others the happiness and
sunny music within their hearts!"</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
